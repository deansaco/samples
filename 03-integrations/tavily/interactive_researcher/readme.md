# Interactive Web Researcher

An intelligent terminal-based research assistant powered by Strands and [Tavily](https://www.tavily.com/). This agent uses Tavily's web search and web crawl API to gather information from reliable sources, extract key insights, and save comprehensive research reports in Markdown format.
